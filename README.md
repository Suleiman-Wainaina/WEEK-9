# WEEK-9
This repo displays my understanding of data analysis.



Problems:
I have noticed that the Netflix shows dataset is quite large. This unique size of the dataset might prove to be a hurdle especially for amateur data analysts who are not yet proficient in data manipulation. 

Interesting thing:
If we can be able to  identify patterns in show genres or release dates. With this large dataset, we might be able to see if there's a focus on specific genres during certain times of the year, suggesting seasonal trends in content production or viewer preferences.
